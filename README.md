#Introduction:

In this Project I made an application to track the blood glucose levels of Gestational Diabetes.

#Features and Functinality:

The application consist of two parts. The first part is the Homepage which basically serves as an informational platform about what Gestational diabetes is,what is the risk factors, how it can be diagnosed or what preventive measure can be taken.

The second part of the application is a diabetes Tracker app that is design to help the individual with gestational diabetes to manage and control their blood glucose level in a more efffective manner.

This application consist of a data entry form where user can enter their personal information like name along with their blood glucose level before and after each meal.After submitting the form, data will be automatically displayed in a tabular format which will help the individuals to monitor their blood glucose level in a more structured and comprehensive manner.

There is also a calculate average button which calculates the average of the records, allowing the individuals to monitor their control on blood glucose level over the day.

If the user want to update or delete their records there is also an Edit button and delete button.

#Tech Stack:

To make this apllication I used axios library to make request from  frontend and nodejs and Express to hanle those request from backend to perform CRUD operation.

In summary, This appliaction will be really helpful for individulas with Gestational diabetes to maintain and control their blood glucose.
