    <h3>Gestational Diabetes: Signs, Causes, and Risk Factors</h3>
    <p>Gestational diabetes is one of the most common health issues that can occur during pregnancy. It happens when the mother is diagnosed with diabetes for the first time while pregnant. <br> The key to minimizing the effects of gestational diabetes is diagnosing it early. If gestational diabetes is misdiagnosed or  not identified, it can lead to conditions that put the baby at risk <br>  for complications or trauma during delivery. </p>

    <h4>What is gestational diabetes?</h4>
    <p> When you eat, your body breaks down sugar and starches from food into glucose to use for energy.Your pancreas makes a hormone called insulin that helps your body keep the right <br> amount of glucose in your blood. When you have diabetes, your body doesn't make enough insulin or it can't use insulin properly, so you end up with too much sugar in your blood. <br> This can cause serious health problems, such as heart disease, kidney failure and blindness. <br> <br>

   Pregnant people are usually tested for gestational diabetes between 24 and 28 weeks of pregnancy.Most of the time it can be controlled and treated during pregnancy.If it's not treated, <br> gestational diabetes can cause problems for you and your baby. It usually goes away after your baby's born.Once you've had gestational diabetes,you have a higher risk of being <br>diagnosed  with diabetes later in life.
    </p>
<h4>Who is at risk for gestational diabetes?</h4>
<p>

    In the United States, 6 out of every 100 pregnant people develop gestational diabetes. You're more likely to have gestational diabetes if you: <br>

    <ul>
        <li>Are older than 25.</li>
        <li>Are overweight or obese and not physically active.</li>
        <li>Have had gestational diabetes or a baby with macrosomia in a past pregnancy.</li>
        <li>Have high blood pressure or you've had heart disease.</li>
        <li>Have polycystic ovarian syndrome (also called polycystic ovary syndrome or PCOS). This is a hormone problem that can affect reproductive and overall health.</li>
        <li>Have prediabetes. This means your blood glucose levels are higher than normal but not high enough to be diagnosed with diabetes.</li>
        <li>Have a parent, brother or sister who has diabetes.</li>
        <li>Are a member of a racial or ethnic group that has a higher prevalence of diabetes that isn't entirely explained <br> by race or ethnicity, such as Black, American Indian or Alaska Native, Asian, Hispanic/Latino or Pacific Islander</li>

    </ul>

    <h4>How do you know if you have gestational diabetes?</h4>
    <p>Your health care provider tests you for gestational diabetes with a prenatal test called a glucose tolerance test.If your provider thinks you're at risk, you may get the test earlier. <br>If the glucose screening test comes back positive, you'll have another test called a glucose tolerance test. After this test, your doctor will be able to tell whether you have gestational diabetes. </p>

</p>

<h4> Have you diagnosed with gestational diabetes?</h4>
<p>If you have gestational diabetes, your provider tells you how often to check your blood sugar, what your levels should be and how to manage them during pregnancy.Blood sugar <br> is affected by pregnancy, what you eat and drink, and how much physical activity you get.You may need to eat differently and be more active. You also  may need <br> to  take insulin shots or other medicines.You can track your blood sugar by our Gestational diabetes tracker App. <br>
